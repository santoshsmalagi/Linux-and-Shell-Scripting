# Command Types

A command can be one of the following:
* **Shell builtin**
    * ```bash``` supports a number of internal commands known as shell builtins. Shell builtins can be of four types:
         * Bourne Shell Builtins: builtin commands inherited from the Bourne Shell.
         * bash Builtins: builtins specific to bash
         * builtins for modifying shell behavior: builtins to modify shell attributes and optional behavior
         * special builtins: Builtin commands classified specially by POSIX.
* **Executable programs**
    * programs can be compiled binaries, such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages, such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on.
* **A shell function**
    * shell functions are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.
* **Alias**
    * an alias is a user defined command, usually built from other commands.

#### List of  ```bash``` builtins
The list of bash builtins can be generated by:
```console
compgen -b
man builtins
help
```
**Common shell builtins:**
```console
alias             # define, or display, the shell's command aliases.
bg                # resume a suspended job so that it runs in the background
break             # exit from a for or while loop
cd                # change the working directory
continue          # skip to the next, or to another, iteration in a for, while, until, or select loop.
exec              # execute a command which replaces the current shell
exit              # exit the shell with an optional numeric status
export            # export a shell variable to become an environment variable 
fg                # move a job to the foreground, making it the shell's current job.
help              # display brief help information about what the shell builtin commands are, and how to use them.
history           # display or modify the history list
kill              # send a signal to a process
pwd               # print the absolute path name of the current working directory
source            # same as . (a period), read commands from a file, and execute them.
type              # determine how the shell will interpret a name: as an alias, function, builtin, file, or keyword.
ulimit            # assign limits to the resources available to processes started by the shell
umask             # set the file creation mask for files created by the shell
unalias           # remove all aliases
unset             # wait for a process to exit, then display its return value
```

### Command types (type)

The ```type``` command can be used to identify the command type.
```console
type <command>
```

### Creating user defined commands (alias)
Aliases are like custom shortcuts used to represent a command (or set of commands). They are often used to chain multiple commands together or create concise representations of commands and their options which are repeatedly used.

```console
alias                              # display a list of all aliases defined for the current shell session
alias ls='ls --color=auto'         # define an alias
alias ll='ls -la'                  # define an alias
unalias ll                         # undefine an alias
```

Alias definitions can be added to the shell configuration files (e.g. ```.bashrc, .bash_alias```) so that they become available for every shell session.
