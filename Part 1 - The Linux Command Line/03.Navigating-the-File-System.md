# Navigating the File System

### Print Working Directory (pwd) 
The ```pwd``` command prints the full path, or location on the filesystem, to the current working directory

```console
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ pwd
/home/santoshsm
```
Upon login to the system, by default the current working directory is set to the user's home directory.

### Change directory (cd)

```console
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ cd Documents
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ pwd
/home/santoshsm/Documents
```

```Shell
cd ~             # change to the home directory
cd /             # change to the root directory
cd ..            # move up one directory level
cd .             # will leave you in same directory
cd               # go to the username's home directory
cd -             # go to the previous directory
cd <subdir>      # change to the subdir within the current working directory
cd ~username     # change to username's home directory
```

### List the contents of the directory (ls)
```console
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ ls
Desktop   Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Vidoes
```

### Displaying a line of text (echo)
echo is a command that outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments

```console
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ echo "Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code"
Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code
```
```echo``` command is commonly used in scripts to display a line of text/string on the STDOUT. It can be combined with a redirection operator to write to a file. For example:

```console
santoshsm@santoshsmalagi:~$ echo "Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code" > CodingPhilosophy.txt
```
### Viewing file contents (less and more)

### Concatenate Files (cat)
The ```cat``` command reads one or more files and copies them to standard output:
