### Command types (type)

The ```type``` command can be used to identify the command type.
```console
type <command>
```

A command can be one of the following:
* **Executable programs**
    * programs can be compiled binaries, such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages, such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on.
* **Shell builtin**
    * ```bash``` supports a number of internal commands known as shell builtins. Shell builtins can be of four types:
         * Bourne Shell Builtins: builtin commands inherited from the Bourne Shell.
         * bash Builtins: builtins specific to bash
         * builtins for modifying shell behavior: builtins to modify shell attributes and optional behavior
         * special builtins: Builtin commands classified specially by POSIX.
* **A shell function**
    * shell functions are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.
* **Alias**
    * an alias is a user defined command, usually built from other commands.

#### List of  ```bash``` builtins
The list of bash builtins can be generated by:
```console
compgen -b
man builtins
help
```
**Common shell builtins:
```console
alias             # define, or display, the shell's command aliases.
bg                # resume a suspended job so that it runs in the background
break             # exit from a for or while loop
cd                # change the working directory
continue          # skip to the next, or to another, iteration in a for, while, until, or select loop.
exec              # execute a command which replaces the current shell
exit              # exit the shell with an optional numeric status
export            # export a shell variable to become an environment variable 
fg                # move a job to the foreground, making it the shell's current job.
help              # display brief help information about what the shell builtin commands are, and how to use them.
history           # display or modify the history list
kill              # send a signal to a process
pwd               # print the absolute path name of the current working directory
source            # same as . (a period), read commands from a file, and execute them.
type              # determine how the shell will interpret a name: as an alias, function, builtin, file, or keyword.
ulimit            # assign limits to the resources available to processes started by the shell
umask             # set the file creation mask for files created by the shell
unalias           # remove all aliases
unset             # wait for a process to exit, then display its return value

### Displaying a command's location (which)
The ```which``` command can determine the location of an executable, this is helpful when more than one version of an executable program is installed on a system. The ```which``` works only for executable programs, not builtins or aliases.

```console
which <command>
```
### Getting help for shell-built in's (help)
```bash``` has a built-in help facility for each of the shell built-in commands, which can be invoked by using ```help``` followed by the name of the shell built-in.

```console
help <shell builtin command>
```
