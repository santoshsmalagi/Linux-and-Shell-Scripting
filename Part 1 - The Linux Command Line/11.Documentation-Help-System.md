### Command types (type)
A command can be one of the following:

* **Executable programs**
    * programs can be compiled binaries, such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages, such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on.
* **Shell builtin**
    * ```bash``` supports a number of commands internally called shell builtins. The ```cd``` command, for example, is a shell builtin. Programs can be compiled binaries, such as 
     programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages, such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, and so on.
* **A shell function**
    * Shell functions are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment.
* **Alias**
    * An alias is a command that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.

The ```type``` command can be used to identify the command type.

```console
type <command>
```

### Displaying a command's location (which)
Sometimes more than one version of an executable program is installed on a system, to determine the exact location of a given executable, the ```which``` command is used ```which``` works only for executable programs, not builtins or aliases that are substitutes for actual executable programs.

```console
which <command>
```
