# Archiving and Compression in Linux

> *Archiving : process of gathering multiple files/directories, and packaging them into a bundle known as a tar file* <br>
  *Compression : process of removing redundancy from data, with an objective of storing it in the smallest possible space* <br>
  *Decompression : process of decompressing compressed files* <br>
  *Synchronozation : detect differences between two remote directories and only perform minimum amount of copying required to bring them in sync with each other* <br>
  *Encryption : encoding files in such a way that only those who are authorized can access it (e.g. GnuPG, bcrypt, ccrypt etc.)* <br>
  *Decryption : decoding encrypted files* <br> <br>
  **Compressing a Compressed file doesn't yield much returns** <br>
  Attempting to compress a file which has already been compressed (using some form of compression algorithm - e.g. .jpg, .mp3 etc.) will actually result in a larger file!! This is
  because all compression techniques involve some overhead which is added to the file to describe the compression. Trying to compress a file, that already contains no redundant
  information will not result in any savings to offset the additional overhead.

Linux provides the following utilities:
* Archiving
  * ```tar``` - *tape archive*, classic utility in Linux for packaging files and directories into archives
* Compression
  * ```gzip``` - compress or expand files
    * ```gunzip``` - expand compressed files
    * ```zcat``` - view the contents of a compressed file without actually decompressing it
  * ```bzip2``` - similar to gzip program, uses a different compression algorithm providing higher levels of compression but at slower speeds
    * ```bunzip2``` - uncompress files compressed with bzip2
    * ```bzip2recover``` - to recover damaged .bz2 files
    * ```bzcat``` - to cat the output of bzip2 compressed files
  * ```zip``` - compress and archive files
    * ```unzip``` - extract the contents of a zip file
  * Others - ```xz```, ```lzma```, ```lza```, ```lz4```, ```brotli```, ```zopfli```, ```zstd```,  ```zpac```, ```pax```, ```peazip```, ```7zip```, ```shar```, ```cpio```, ```ar```, ```kgb``` etc.

### Archiving (tar)


### Compressing and decompressing (gzip, bzip2, zip)

#### gzip
#### bzip2

#### zip
The ```zip``` program is both a compression tool and an archiver. Linux users mostly use the ```zip``` program as a means to exchange data with Windows based systems, as *zip* files can be natively read on Windows systems.

```console
zip options zipfile file1 file2....
```
Unlike ```tar``` + ```gzip```, ```zip``` compresses each file individually, and leaves the "directory" information about the constituent files un-compressed. This makes it easy to work with individual files in the archive (insert, delete, decompress, etc.) but also means that it usually won't get as good of compression overall. One more interesting difference (vs tar) is that, if an existing archive is specified then new files are added and matching files are replaced, but the archive itself is preserved.

```console
zip -r data.zip data                     # if -r option is not used then the contents under data directory 
                                           are not added recursively to the zip file. 
                                           numeric value indicates the amount of compression achieved.
zip -r -Z bzip2 data.zip data            # to specify a compression technique
zip -9 -r data.zip data                  # to specify a level of compression
zip -e  data.zip data                    # password protect a zip file
ls -l /etc/ | zip ls-etc.zip -           # compress output from other programs
unzip data.zip
unzip -l data.zip data/share/DFWStats/   # -l option causes the files to be only listed and not extracted 
unzip data.zip data/share/DFWStats       # selectively unzip data
unzip -p ls-etc.zip | less               # output to STDOUT when -p flag is used
```

### File extentions for archives and compressed files
```tar``` itself doesn't feature native data compression, so tar archives are compressed using one of the compression utilities like ```gzip```, ```zip```, ```bzip2```, ```xz``` etc. To identify the type of compression utility used, the resulting tar files are either named with a single extension, e.g. .tgz, .tbz, .txz, .tzst, or with double file extension, e.g. .tar.gz, .tar.br, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, .tar.zst etc.

**Compression utilities*** ```gzip``` **and** ```bzip2``` **when used standalone (without tar) can only operate on files and not directories.**  

* *.tar* - no compression, only a package of files/sub-directories
* *.gz* - ```gunzip``` compressed file
  * *.tgz, .tar.gz* - ```tar``` + ```gunzip``` based on the DEFLATE algorithm (a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding)
* *.bz2* - ```bzip2``` compressed file
  * *.tbz, .tar.bz2* - ```tar``` + ```bzip2``` based on the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler algorithm
* *.xz* - ```xz``` compressed file
  * *.txz, .tar.xz* - ```tar``` + ```xz``` based on the LZMA2 algorithm
* *.zip* - *zip* - permits several algorithms though DEFLATE is the most common
* *.br* - ```br``` compressed file
  * *.tbr, .tar.br* - ```tar``` + ```br``` based on the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling
* *.zst* - ```zst``` compressed file
  * *.tzst, .tar.zst* - ```tar``` + ```zstd``` based on the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and FSE
  
>  *In general, for most practical applications the combination of tar + gzip compression provides the most optimal space (file size) and time (compression-decompression time) performance.*
