# Archiving and File Compresion-Decompression in Linux

> *Archiving : process of gathering multiple files/directories, and packaging them into a bundle known as a tar file* <br>
  *Compression : process of removing redundancy from data, with an objective of storing it in the smallest possible space* <br>
  *Decompression : process of decompressing compressed files* <br>
  *Synchronozation : detect differences between two remote directories and only perform minimum amount of copying required to bring them in sync with each other* <br>
  *Encryption : encoding files in such a way that only those who are authorized can access it (e.g. GnuPG, bcrypt, ccrypt etc.)* <br>
  *Decryption : decoding encrypted files* <br> <br>
  **Compressing a Compressed file doesn't yield much returns** <br>
  Attempting to compress a file which has already been compressed (using some form of compression algorithm - e.g. .jpg, .mp3 etc.) will actually result in a larger file!! This is
  because all compression techniques involve some overhead which is added to the file to describe the compression. Trying to compress a file, that already contains no redundant
  information will not result in any savings to offset the additional overhead.

Linux provides the following utilities:
* Archiving
  * ```tar``` - *tape archive*, classic utility in Linux for making archives
* Compression
  * ```gzip``` - compress or expand files
    * ```gunzip``` - expand compressed files
    * ```zcat``` - view the contents of a compressed file without actually decompressing it
  * ```bzip2``` - similar to gzip program, uses a different compression algorithm providing higher levels of compression but at slower speeds
    * ```bunzip2``` - uncompress files compressed with bzip2
    * ```bzip2recover``` - to recover damaged .bz2 files
    * ```bzcat``` - to cat the output of bzip2 compressed files
  * ```zip``` - compress and package files
  * Others - ```xz```, ```lzma```, ```lza```, ```lz4```, ```brotli```, ```zopfli``, ```zstd```, , ```zpac```, ```pax```, ```peazip```, ```7zip```, ```shar```, ```cpio```, ```ar```, ```kgb``` etc.
* Synchronization
  * ```rsync``` - remote file and directory synchronization

### Archiving (tar)

### Compressing and decompressing (gzip, bzip2, zip)
Unlike tar + gzip, it compresses each file individually, and leaves the "directory" information about the constituent files un-compressed. This makes it easy to work with individual files in the archive (insert, delete, decompress, etc.) but also means that it usually won't get as good of compression overall.

### Synchronizing files and directories (rsync)
Files and directories can be backed up by keeping them synchronized with a remote/local copy. Linux provides the ```rsync``` utility to execute this task. ```rsync``` can synchronize both remote and local directories using the *rsync remote update* protocol.

```console
rsync options source destination
```

### File extentions for archives and compressed files
```tar``` itself doesn't feature native data compression, so tar archives are compressed using one of the compression utilities like ```gzip```, ```zip```, ```bzip2```, ```xz``` etc. To identify the type of compression utility used, the resulting tar files are either named with a single extension, e.g. .tgz, .tbz, .txz, .tzst, or with double file extension, e.g. .tar.gz, .tar.br, .tar.bz2, .tar.xz, .tar.zst etc.

* *.tar* - no compression, only a package of files/sub-directories
* *.gz* - 
  * *.tgz, .tar.gz* - ```tar``` + ```gunzip``` based on the DEFLATE algorithm (a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding)
* *.bz2* - 
  * *.tbz, .tar.bz2* - ```tar``` + ```bzip2``` based on the Burrowsâ€“Wheeler algorithm
* *.xz* - 
  * *.txz, .tar.xz* - ```tar``` + ```xz``` based on the LZMA2 algorithm
* *.zip* - *zip* - permits several algorithms though DEFLATE is the most common
* *.br* -
  * *.tbr, .tar.br* - ```tar``` + ```br``` based on the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling
* *.zst* - 
  * *.tzst, .tar.zst* - ```tar``` + ```zstd``` based on the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and FSE
  
>  *In general, for most practical applications the combination of tar + gzip compression provides the most optimal space (file size) and time (compression-decompression time) performance.*
