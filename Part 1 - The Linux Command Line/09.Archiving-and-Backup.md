# Archiving and Backup in Linux

Compression and archiving programs are used for two purposes:
* Making backups of files and directories
* Moving large amount of data (files and directories) from one location to the other

Linux provides the following utilities:
* ```gzip``` - compress or expand files
* ```gunzip``` - expand compressed files
* ```zcat``` - view the contents of a compressed file without actually decompressing it
* ```bzip2```
* ```bunzip2```
* ```bzcat```
* ```tar```
* ```zip```
* ```rsync``` - remote file and directory synchronization

### Compress or expand files (gzip, unzip, bzip2)
### Archiving (tar)
### Synchronizing files and directories (rsync)
