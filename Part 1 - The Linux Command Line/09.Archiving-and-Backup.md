# Archiving and Backup in Linux

> *Compression : process of removing redundancy from data, with an objective of storing it in the smallest possible space* <br>
  *Archiving : process of gathering multiple files/directories, and packaging them into a bundle known as a tar file* <br>
  *Synchronozation : detect differences between two remote directories and only perform minimum amount of copying required to bring them in sync with each other*

> **Compressing a Compressed file doesn't yeild much returns***
  Attempting to compress a file which has already been compressed (using some form of compression algorithm - e.g. .jpg, .mp3 etc.) will actually result in a larger file!! This is because all compression techniques involve some overhead which is added to the file to describe the compression. Trying to compress a file, that already contains no redundant information will not result in any savings to offset the additional overhead.

Linux provides the following utilities:
* Compression
  * ```gzip``` - compress or expand files
    * ```gunzip``` - expand compressed files
    * ```zcat``` - view the contents of a compressed file without actually decompressing it
  * ```bzip2``` - similar to gzip program, uses a different compression algorithm providing higher levels of compression but at slower speeds
    * ```bunzip2``` - uncompress files compressed with bzip2
    * ```bzip2recover``` - to recover damaged .bz2 files
    * ```bzcat``` - to cat the output of bzip2 compressed files
  * ```zip``` - compress and package files
  * ```xz``` - 
  * ```brotli``` - 
  * ```zstandard``` - 
* Archiving
  * ```tar``` - *tape archive*, classic utility in Linux for making archives
* Synchronization
  * ```rsync``` - remote file and directory synchronization

### Compress or expand files (gzip, unzip, bzip2)

### Archiving (tar)


### Synchronizing files and directories (rsync)

### File Extentions for archives and compressed files
```tar``` itself doesn't feature native data compression, so tar archives are compressed using one of the compression utilities like ```gzip, bzip2, compress or lzma```. To identify the type of compression utility used, the resulting tar files are either named with a single extension, e.g. TGZ, TBZ, TXZ, TZST, or with double file extension, e.g. TAR.GZ, TAR.BR, TAR.BZ2, TAR.XZ, TAR.ZST.

* *.tar* - 
* *.tar.gz* - 
* *.zip* - 
* *.bz2* -
