# Archiving and Backup in Linux

Compression and archiving programs are used for two purposes:
* Making backups of files and directories
* Moving large amount of data (files and directories) from one location to the other

> *Compression : process of removing redundancy from data, with an objective of storing it in the smallest possible space* <br>
  *Archiving : process of gathering multiple files/directories, and packaging them into a bundle known as a tar file* <br>
  *Synchronozation : detect differences between two remote directories and only perform minimum amount of copying required to bring them in sync*

Linux provides the following utilities:
* ```gzip``` - compress or expand files
* ```gunzip``` - expand compressed files
* ```zcat``` - view the contents of a compressed file without actually decompressing it
* ```bzip2``` - similar to gzip program, uses a different compression algorithm providing higher levels of compression but at slower speeds
* ```bunzip2``` - uncompress files compressed with bzip2
* ```bzip2recover``` - to recover damaged .bz2 files
* ```bzcat``` - to cat the output of bzip2 compressed files
* ```tar``` - 
* ```zip``` - compress and package files
* ```rsync``` - remote file and directory synchronization

### Compress or expand files (gzip, unzip, bzip2)
### Archiving (tar)
### Synchronizing files and directories (rsync)
