# Searching for Files in Linux

### Quick file name search (locate)
The ```locate``` command performs a quick database search of a string and outputs the name of the matched files along with their complete or absolute paths in the output.

```console
locate <filename>       # return a search of all pathnames containing the substring <filename>
locate -c "/bin/zip"    # display a count of entries matching /bin/zip 
locate -n 9 "*.html"    # limit search queries to a specific number i.e. only 9 entries
locate -i "TeXt"        # ignore case sensitive output
locate -e "README"      # force locate to only print those entries which correspond to existing files on the system
locate -r "bzip2"       # search for an exact filename, otherwise all strings having the matching substring are displayed
sudo updatedb           # update the locate database
locate -S               # view information about the locate database
```
> **Drawbacks of using the locate command** <br>
  Unlike the ```find``` command which performs a search of the file system and looks through the directory hierarchies, locate searches a database generated by the ```updatedb``` program, thereby returning quick results. The caveat to this approach is that, if the database is not updated (the ```updatedb``` program is run periodically) then locate is not efficient. For example, recently created files or directories may not show up, or files deleted a while ago might still show up. One way of overcoming this limitation is to run ```updatedb``` command manually. **However, another major drawback is that it requires superuser privilages to run the updatedb command!**. So the ```locate``` command is kind of a quick and easy hack, but not a full fledged replacement of ```find```. Other useful tricks would be to combine ```locate``` output with ```grep```.


### Searching for files in Linux (find)
```console
find ~                 # print a list of all files in the user home directory, including dot files

```
