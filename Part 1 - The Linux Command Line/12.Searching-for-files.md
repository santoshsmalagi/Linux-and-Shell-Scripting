# Searching for Files in Linux

### Quick file name search (locate)
The ```locate``` command performs a quick database search of a string and outputs the name of the matched files along with their complete or absolute paths in the output.

```console
locate <filename>       # return a search of all pathnames containing the substring <filename>
locate -c "/bin/zip"    # display a count of entries matching /bin/zip 
locate -n 9 "*.html"    # limit search queries to a specific number i.e. only 9 entries
locate -i "TeXt"        # ignore case sensitive output
locate -e "README"      # force locate to only print those entries which correspond to existing files on the system
locate -r "bzip2"       # search for an exact filename, otherwise all strings having the matching substring are displayed
sudo updatedb           # update the locate database
locate -S               # view information about the locate database
```
> **Drawbacks of using the locate command** <br>
  Unlike the ```find``` command which performs a search of the file system and looks through the directory hierarchies, locate searches a database generated by the ```updatedb``` program, thereby returning quick results. The caveat to this approach is that, if the database is not updated (the ```updatedb``` program is run periodically) then locate is not efficient. For example, recently created files or directories may not show up, or files deleted a while ago might still show up. One way of overcoming this limitation is to run ```updatedb``` command manually. **However, another major drawback is that it requires superuser privilages to run the updatedb command!**. So the ```locate``` command is kind of a quick and easy hack, but not a full fledged replacement of ```find```. Other useful tricks would be to combine ```locate``` output with ```grep```.


### Searching for files in Linux (find)
```find``` command searches a given directory (and its subdirectories) for files based on a variety of attributes. These attributes can be broadly classified into three categories and the most common ones are:
* Tests
    * find files by ```-type```: block special device file (b), character special device file (c), directory (d), regular file (f), symbolic link (l)
    * find files by ```-size:``` b (512 byte blocks), c (bytes), w (2-byte words), k (Kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (Gigabytes)
        * a leading '+' indicates files larger than specified size (e.g. +1M - larger than 1M), '-' indicates files smaller than specified size, no sign means match exactly
    * find files by ```-name \<pattern\>:``` find files using the specified pattern
        * the pattern is enclosed in quotes to avoid pathname expansion, special characters are escaped using backslash
    * find files by ```-user <name>:``` find files belonging to a specified user
* Operations
* Actions 

```console
find ~                 # print a list of all files in the user home directory, including dot files

```
