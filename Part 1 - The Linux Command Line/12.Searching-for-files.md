# Searching for Files in Linux

### Quick file name search (locate)
The ```locate``` command performs a quick database search of pathnames and outputs every path matching the input string. 

```Shell
locate <filename>       
```
> **Drawbacks of using the locate command** <br>
  Unlike the ```find``` command which performs a search of the file system and looks through the directory hierarchies, locate searches a database generated by the ```updatedb``` program, thereby returning quick results. The caveat to this approach is that, if the database is not updated (usually the ```updatedb``` command runs as a cron job) then locate is not efficient. For example, recently created files or directories may not show up, or files deleted a while ago might still show up. One way of overcoming this limitation is to run ```updatedb``` command manually. **However, another major drawback is it requires superuser privilages to run the updatedb command!**. So the ```locate``` command is a quick and easy way to find things and not a full fledged replacement of ```find```. Other useful tricks would be to combine ```locate``` output with ```grep```.
